# RSA in C

A port of an OCaml implementation to C. This project is an attempt to practically implement concepts learned in my *Arithmetic and Algebra 3* course.

## To-Do List
- Make the program viable for messages of any length.
- Implement an RSA-AES hybrid (encrypt message with AES, encrypt AES key with RSA).
